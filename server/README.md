## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Database Configuration

This project uses **SQLite3** as the database for development and testing. SQLite3 is a lightweight, file-based database that doesn't require a separate server process.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server root directory with the following variable:

```env
DB_STORAGE=./database.sqlite
```

- `DB_STORAGE`: Path to the SQLite database file (default: `./database.sqlite`)

### Database Setup

The database file will be created automatically when you run migrations. To set up the database:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run migrations and seeds (creates database file)
$ npm run db

# For Windows users
$ npm run db:win
```

### Database Scripts

- `npm run db` - Recreates the database from scratch (Unix/Mac)
- `npm run db:win` - Recreates the database from scratch (Windows)

This script will:
1. Delete the existing database file
2. Run all migrations to create tables
3. Run all seeds to populate test data

### Migration Commands

```bash
# Run pending migrations
$ npx sequelize db:migrate

# Undo last migration
$ npx sequelize db:migrate:undo

# Run seeds
$ npx sequelize db:seed:all
```

### PostgreSQL vs SQLite3

This project was migrated from PostgreSQL to SQLite3. Key differences:

| Feature | PostgreSQL | SQLite3 |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Setup** | Requires server installation | File-based, no server needed |
| **ARRAY type** | Native support | Stored as JSON strings |
| **Date functions** | `NOW()` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` |
| **Connection** | Network (host, port, credentials) | File path |
| **Use case** | Production, multi-user | Development, testing, small apps |

**Note:** Array fields (like `Trainer.qualificationImages`) are automatically serialized to JSON strings in the database and deserialized to arrays in the application code.

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "SQLITE_ERROR: no such table"**
- Run `npm run db` to create all tables

**Error: "database is locked"**
- Close all connections to the database
- Restart the application

**Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"**
- Check that `DB_STORAGE` path in `.env` is correct
- Ensure the directory exists (SQLite will create the file, but not the directory)

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
